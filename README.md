# C-Programming-Practice
This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate C programs, organized by core topics in the C language. It is designed to help reinforce fundamental programming concepts through hands-on code practice.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Variables & Data Types  
- Conditionals  
- Loops  
- Functions & Recursion  
- Arrays  
- Pointers  
- Strings  
- Structures & File I/O  

## 📁 Structure
Each topic is placed inside a separate folder and contains multiple `.c` files named clearly (e.g., `CH1_P1.c`, `CH4_P2.c`, etc.).  
This organization allows easy navigation and copying for quick reference or practice.

## 🧪 How to Use
- Browse by topic folder to find the relevant programs.
- Open any `.c` file to view the code and logic.
- You can clone the repository and run the programs locally using a C compiler (e.g., GCC with VS Code).

## 🚧 Status
Work in progress — updated regularly as new topics are covered and new code is written.
